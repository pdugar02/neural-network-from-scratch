# neural-network-from-scratch
Implement a simple perceptron network using only numpy, evaluating it on MNIST

Project originally completed June 2021. I used a perceptron network and numpy to build a neural network without using any pre-built classifiers.
The network attains ~95% accuracy on the MNIST test set after 2 epochs of training, and ~98% after 5 epochs.
